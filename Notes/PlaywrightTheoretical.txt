SDET:--

Levels of testing:--
Unit
Integration

UAT
 
Selenium and Playwright:---
both are cross platform
both support 5 lang
Playwright- All types of browsers including mobile but cannot support native mobile app automation\
Selenium code has to be written to automate mob apps whereas playwright - inbuilt prop to test mob web browsers
Playwright provides tracing , Web first assertions compared to Selenium

npm install typescript --save-dev
npx tsc
npx tsc --init
npx playwright show-report
npx playwright test --ui
npx playwright test
Runs the end-to-end tests.
npx playwright test --ui
Starts the interactive UI mode.
npx playwright test --project=chromium
Runs the tests only on Desktop Chrome.
npx playwright test example
Runs the tests in a specific file.
npx playwright test --debug
Runs the tests in debug mode.
npx playwright codegen
Auto generate tests with Codegen.
We suggest that you begin by typing:
npx playwright test
Update Playwright and download new browser binaries and their dependencies:
npm install -D @playwright/test@latest
npx playwright install --with-deps
To specify which browser you would like to run your tests on, use the --project flag followed by the browser name.
npx playwright test --project webkit
To specify multiple browsers to run your tests on, use the --project flag multiple times followed by each browser name.
npx playwright test --project webkit --project firefox
To run only the tests that failed in the last test run, first run your tests and then run them again with the --last-failed flag.
npx playwright test --last-failed

		Playwright with TS

					7th Oct- 2025

1. JDK
2. IDE- Eclipse/Intelij
3. Selenium WebDriver - 
4. TestNG
5. WebDriverManager - Browser Driver
6. Apache POI
7. ExtentReport

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Playwright - Level of Testing

1. Unit
2. Integration - API
3. System
4. UAT- BDD (Cucumber)

Automation Guidelines :100%
-----------------------------------------
1. Application knowledge :
2. Test case availability :-  50%

3. Tools - Playwright + TS: 50%
		
		90%-95% - Playwright
		5% TypeScript - 

4. Programming Concept :-- OOPS

----------------------------------------
Package
Class - Java
Object
Methods/function

inheritance : 

En capsulation:--


WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver()

if else

elseif

for loop

global and local variable

switch case 

operator

+
-

Data Types :

-------------------------------------------
Automation for any application.

1. 20-25 object/controls :- 

2. CRUD operation
	UI		API		Database
C	Create
R	Read
U	Update
D	Delete

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Playwright Limitation:

1. Mobile native app: 
2. Thick Client - Desktop 


TakesScreenshot 

driver.findElement(By.id("")).SendKeys()

---------------------------------------------------------------

Playwright Setup : JS/TS

1. nodejs :- javascript/typescript - Done
2. IDE - Visual Studio Code
3. Playwright

Day 2
1.Is TypeScript Statically Typed?

TypeScript is optionally statically typed, meaning it allows developers to specify types for variables, functions, and objects, enabling type checking at compile time. This feature helps catch type-related errors early in the development process, improving code reliability and maintainability.

In a statically typed language, type checking occurs during compilation, and variables must adhere to their declared types. For example, in TypeScript:

let value: number = 5;
value = "Hello"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
Copy
Here, the compiler enforces that value remains a number, preventing runtime errors caused by type mismatches.



2.Benefits of Static Typing in TypeScript

Early Error Detection: Type mismatches are caught during compilation, reducing runtime errors.

Improved IDE Support: Features like code completion, refactoring, and type hints are enhanced.

Code Predictability: Static typing ensures consistent use of variables and functions, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain

3.How do you explicitly declare a variable with a type in TypeScript?

let name: string = "Alice"

4.Can typescript be run directly on browser??

Browsers do not understand TypeScript, so it must be compiled to JavaScript using the TypeScript Compiler (tsc)

5. To change bgm color n font color??

CTRL+SHIFT+P -Color theme 

6.npx playwright codegen demo.playwright.dev/todomvc

7.Placeholder locator:--
<input type="email" placeholder="name@example.com" />
await page
    .getByPlaceholder('name@example.com')
    .fill('playwright@microsoft.com');

8.Xpath
Relative: Father/Son
Absolute: Great grand/Grand/Father/Son

R: //tagname[@attribute='']

9.Why async and await is used only in TS/JS
coz it works asynchronously if async and await is used to execute every line after line
it'll wait for each line to get executed
if not used all line will be executed at once/parallel
EG: Login n Logout gets executed at once which doesn't make sense

10.How to debug certain code
add await page.pause()from whre u want the code to be debugged
and in inspector > Click on "get over" to start line by line debugging


Day3
SDET note Day 3
Diff between to have and to contain
to have: to hv exact content
to contain: to contain partial content

Day 4
textInput: used when there is input used fr the locator
textContent : when no input is used while inspecthng

Special Control:
1.Mousehover
2.Dragndrop
3.Rightclick
4.Doubleclick
5.Pagination :1 2 3 4 5 6........ used in sites to view page 1 or 2 or 3 or more data 
6.Datepicker (Calendar)
7.Using Visual Test to test Ui/UX (looknfeel)
8.Alerts WEbalert and windowalert(cannot be inspected and also kniwn as js alert)
9.frame/iframe/frameset- arrangin elements


normalise-space()=''

Click
click.("")
locator().click

Wait time for actions
input 30sec
expect 5sec

findelement -> $
findelements -> $$

salaryCell?textContent()
//? is used for soft crash instead of harsh

Pagination - no of pages on website 1 2 3 4 5 ..........
